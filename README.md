AgressoPP
=========

A javascript plugin to improve user experience in Agresso's time reporting system

Due to some reason Agresso time reporting systed doesn't allow users to 
enter time in HH:MM format. It also use confusing coloring scheme for 
marking flex time (red for the extra hours you have earned and green for the
hours you own to the company). It feels like user interface and usability had
had the lowest prio in development. And later it was skipped.

This script fixes issues mentioned above:
1. It allows you to enter time in HH:MM format
2. It uses a more convinient color scheme for the flex time indication

To see the difference please take a look on pictures in Demo folder.

You can use it with TamperMonkey extension (http://tampermonkey.net/). Was 
tested on Mozilla and Chrome browsers. If you miss some other features, 
please contact me.
